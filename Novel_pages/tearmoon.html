                                Mia Luna Tearmoon, Princess of the Tearmoon Empire, muttered to herself as she stood shackled on the execution platform.
                                
                                The faces of the spectators surrounding her were, without exception, filled with indignation.
                                
                                Before long, Mia was executed at the hands of the revolutionists, who were fed up with the heavy taxation.
                                
                                But the next moment, she unexpectedly found herself lying on her bed.
                                
                                It was eight years ago, when she was just a mere kid.
                                
                                For a while, Mia even wondered if she was hallucinating. However, what appeared on her bedside table was a bloodstained diary that she had written herself.
                                
                                That day, Mia’s screams could be heard echoing throughout the palace.
                                
                                Mia was not a vicious person by nature. She was simply incapable of understanding the pain and hunger of others, and by the time she discovered it, it was already too late to do anything.
                                
                                After she regressed back to her childhood, Mia struggled hard to trace back the events of the past with the help of her blood-stained diary and memories.
                                
                                Was it to save the future of a declining empire?
                                
                                Was it to save the soldiers who died in the civil war?
                                
                                Was it to save the people from famine?
                                
                                No, she had only one goal.
                                
                                To avert her fate of facing the guillotine (execution)!</p>

Only to wake back up as a twelve-year-old! With time rewound and a second chance at life dropped into her lap, she sets out to right the countless wrongs that plague the ailing Empire. Corrupt governance? Check. Border troubles? Check. Natural calamities and economic strife? Check. My, seems like a lot of work. Hard work and Mia don’t mix, so she seeks out the aid of others, starting with her loyal maid, Anne, and the brilliant minister, Ludwig. Together, they strive day and night to restore the Empire. Little by little, their tireless efforts begin to change the course of history, pushing the whole of the continent toward a new future. And why did the selfish princess have a change of heart, you ask? Simple—she didn’t. She’s just terrified of the guillotine. Dying hurt like hell, and Mia hates pain more than work.</p>

Ever since the spoiled princess of Tearmoon leapt through time and restarted life as a twelve-year-old, everything has been going her way. Leveraging her memory of future events and—unwittingly—the delusions of those around her, she secures a source of wheat for the coming famine and prevents civil war from breaking out. She even manages to avert her own grisly death by guillotine, erasing from existence the very diary that foretold her doom! But once again that dreaded word—revolution—reaches her ears, only this time, it's not in Tearmoon. She's horrified to learn that a popular uprising in Remno is threatening that kingdom's stability. To make matters worse Abel, her princely sweetheart, is trapped at the center of the chaos. Should she brave danger to mount a rescue, or sit safe in the comfort of her own castle? Freed from the curse of the guillotine and faced with an uncertain future, what path will Mia choose?</p>

By which she means, of course, do absolutely nothing productive and lounge around in bed all day. Her indolent plans are cut short when her granddaughter, Bel, is whisked backwards through time and deposited in front of her. Just when she thought she was finally done with worrying about the guillotine, she learns of the grisly future awaiting her, in which a war of succession rends the empire in two. Mia herself has been killed by poison, and Bel narrowly avoided execution by leaping through time. Altering the course of history will, of all things, require her to defeat Rafina in the upcoming election for student council president! Underprepared, polling abysmally, and trailed by a granddaughter who inherited all her, erm, Mia-est quirks, she once again finds herself at a historical turning point... without the faintest clue of what she's supposed to do!</p>

You’d think saving the future would be enough to earn her some rest, but all she got for her troubles was an urgent letter from Ludwig requesting her immediate return to the empire. She sets out for Tearmoon, only to learn upon arriving that the academy city, which she was counting on, is now falling apart before their very eyes. The headmaster? Bailed on them. The teachers? Fleeing by the boatload. The project itself? At risk of grinding to a halt. And to make matters worse, the Greenmoons are apparently the ones behind it all! Ludwig offers a solution: they need a new headmaster with enough clout to stop the exodus of teachers, and his former master fits the bill. Sounds great! The only problem is...the man’s a stubborn old badger who hates nobles with a burning passion!</p>

Stranded on a deserted island sans boat and supplies, she and her friends need to figure out how to survive. Well, she and most of her friends, because Esmeralda has gone missing! The group decides to split up to look for her, and Mia gets paired up with Abel. Hey, maybe being stuck on an island isn’t so bad! Especially if it means she gets to be alone with her sweetheart. Little does she know, deep within the island lies a dark secret lost to time. In unearthing it she will learn the hidden truth of the Tearmoon Empire... and how it’s inextricably linked to her own morbid fate. Can Mia break free of the bonds of history and avert her ever-impending doom? Maybe, but not before she gets in some quality flirting time! After all, Mia’s primary concern is and always will be herself, and the only bond she’s interested in right now is the one with Abel. Too bad the island isn’t about to let her have her way...</p>
