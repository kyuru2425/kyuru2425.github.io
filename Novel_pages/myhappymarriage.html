                                I on the other hand, other than having the same blood flowing through our veins, was just a servant. My appearance was shabby, I had no education nor did I inherit any psionic abilities. I was an unloved, unwanted daughter.

                                            ​Born talentless to a noble family famous for their supernatural abilities, Miyo Saimori is forced into an existence of servitude by her abusive stepmother. When Miyo finally comes of marriageable age, though, her hopes of being whisked away to a better life crumble after she discovers her fiancé’s identity: Kiyoka Kudou, a commander apparently so cold and cruel that his previous would-be brides all fled within three days of their engagements. With no home to return to, Miyo resigns herself to her fate—and soon finds that her pale and beautiful husband-to-be is anything but the monster she expected. As they slowly open their hearts to each other, both realize the other may be their chance at finding true love and happiness.</p>

                                            When Miyo Saimori, the unwanted daughter of a declining noble family, is married off to coldhearted military commander Kiyoka Kudou, no one expects their betrothal to last. Against all odds, however, the unlikely couple find themselves drawn to each other’s kindness, and their engagement becomes official. Wanting to prove herself to her talented fiancé, Miyo starts studying etiquette with the goal of making her social debut at an upcoming dinner party. When she refuses to confide in anyone about her dreams (which are becoming more terrifying by the night), though, her health rapidly declines. This provides a third party the perfect opportunity to widen the rift developing between Miyo and Kiyoka…</p>
