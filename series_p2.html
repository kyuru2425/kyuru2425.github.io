                                        Born talentless to a noble family famous for their supernatural abilities, Miyo Saimori is forced into an existence of servitude by her abusive stepmother. When Miyo finally comes of marriageable age, though, her hopes of being whisked away to a better life crumble after she discovers her fiancé's identity: Kiyoka Kudou, a commander apparently so cold and cruel that his previous would-be brides all fled within three days of their engagements. With no home to return to, Miyo resigns herself to her fate—and soon finds that her pale and beautiful husband-to-be is anything but the monster she expected. As they slowly open their hearts to each other, both realize the other may be their chance at finding true love and happiness.</p>

Sadly, YGGDRASIL's servers are about to be shut down, and nearly all of its members from the guild of Ainz Ooal Gown have already stopped playing. Deciding to stay in the game until the server goes down, Momonga goes and to sit on the throne of Nazarick.

                                        Eventually, the clock strikes midnight, but the game doesn't log him out even after the server shutdown. NPCs start to have their own will, and he becomes the strongest magic caster with the appearance of a skeleton - Momonga's true legend now begins!

The only way for them to escape is by clearing all the floors of Aincrad, the floating castle that is the setting for the game, and defeating the final boss. Death in-game means death in the real world, due to the NerveGear, a console that simulates the in-game character controls by redirecting brain signals. Two years after the start of the death game, out of the original ten thousand players at the start, less than seven thousand remain with twenty-five floors left to clear.

Only to wake back up as a twelve-year-old! With time rewound and a second chance at life dropped into her lap, she sets out to right the countless wrongs that plague the ailing Empire. Corrupt governance? Check. Border troubles? Check. Natural calamities and economic strife? Check. My, seems like a lot of work. Hard work and Mia don’t mix, so she seeks out the aid of others, starting with her loyal maid, Anne, and the brilliant minister, Ludwig. Together, they strive day and night to restore the Empire. Little by little, their tireless efforts begin to change the course of history, pushing the whole of the continent toward a new future. And why did the selfish princess have a change of heart, you ask? Simple—she didn’t. She’s just terrified of the guillotine. Dying hurt like hell, and Mia hates pain more than work.

The four—mage Frieren, hero Himmel, priest Heiter, and warrior Eisen—reminisce about their decade-long journey as the moment to bid each other farewell arrives. But the passing of time is different for elves, thus Frieren witnesses her companions slowly pass away one by one.

                                        Before his death, Heiter manages to foist a young human apprentice called Fern onto Frieren. Driven by the elf's passion for collecting a myriad of magic spells, the pair embarks on a seemingly aimless journey, revisiting the places that the heroes of yore had visited. Along their travels, Frieren slowly confronts her regrets of missed opportunities to form deeper bonds with her now-deceased comrades.</p>
